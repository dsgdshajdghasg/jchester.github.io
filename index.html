      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I am a 2nd year Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) student at National University – Manila.</p>
      <p>I was born in Rodriguez, Rizal on October 25, 2006.</p>

      <p>
        My journey in programming began when I was in Grade 10. I discovered coding and quickly became interested because I truly enjoyed it.
        I started learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later, I discovered Python and learned how to create simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
      </p>

      <p>
        When I reached Grade 12, we were assigned a project to help individuals with hearing impairments. My team and I developed a prototype called
        <strong>RETINA</strong>, which stands for <em>Responsive Eyewear with Translation and Interpretation for Natural Assistance</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RETINA device was designed to help people who do not know sign language understand those who use it. It was powered by a Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB).
        Our AI program could run at 17 frames per second using the Raspberry Pi. We trained it using 10,000 images, although it could only detect 5 sign language gestures.
        When a gesture was detected, the device could output both text and sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project earned the <strong>Top 1 position</strong> with a score of <strong>94.71%</strong>, which helped me and my friends graduate with High and Highest Honors.
        Unfortunately, despite the project’s potential to impact the hearing-impaired community, it didn’t receive the recognition we had hoped for.
      </p>

      <p>
        After this experience, I thought I might pursue a computer-related course like Computer Science, Information Technology, or Electronics Engineering.
        But deep down, my dream has always been to become a Civil Engineer. That’s why I chose to take Civil Engineering — yet my passion for coding never stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my first year in college, out of boredom, I improved the RETINA program by shifting from image processing to hand landmark detection.
        I wrote the code in just one hour, though data gathering and model training took a full week because I was also focused on my studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that same year, I also learned how to code using C++. As part of another school project, I created a <strong>Concrete Mix Calculator</strong>.
        Users simply input the area, and the calculator uses a fixed concrete thickness of 18 cm (since I was still learning about concrete strength).
        The program then automatically calculates the required volume and estimates the cost of materials — cement, sand, and aggregates.

      <h2>Thank You for Visiting</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Even though I chose a different field, my passion for programming continues to grow.
        I believe that combining engineering knowledge with technology can lead to innovative solutions that truly help people.
        This is just the beginning of my journey — and I’m excited for what’s next.
